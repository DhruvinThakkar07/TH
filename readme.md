# Treasure Hunt:

This is a web application that consists of a treasure hunt game in which users have to answer 5 questions to win the treasure. The game aims to test the user's knowledge and skills in a fun and interactive way.
To participate in the treasure hunt or view the dashboard, users must first log in using their email and password. If a user tries to access the treasure hunt or dashboard without logging in, they will be redirected to the login page.
The application uses cookies and sessions to ensure that users do not have to log in again if they accidentally navigate to another page. If a user refreshes the page during a question, the same question is displayed again.
If a user accidentally logs out during the hunt, they are redirected to the question where they left the hunt. When a new user registers, they are automatically taken to the treasure hunt without having to log in again. The user's progress is saved, allowing them to continue the treasure hunt from where they left off. If a user logs out and logs in again later, they can pick up the treasure hunt from where they left off.
Once the user completes the game, they are directed to a Congratulations page. The dashboard displays the user's accuracy in answering the questions as well as the total time taken to complete the treasure hunt.
